<p>I pretty much stopped sharing online after becoming a manager. Initially I thought it was because of lack of motivation – meetings seemed to have sucked up all my desire for expression, and I didn’t bother to get stuff cleared by comms. Later I realized that it was really imposter syndrome that held me back the most – I was worried that I’d say something dumb and all my colleagues and reports would notice and respect me less.</p>
<p>I literally debated with myself for days – should I make a blog post, vlog, or just forget about it and save some time? Eventually convinced myself to at least start a draft and if I didn’t like it, I simply wouldn’t have to post it. Turns out the draft felt OK, and I was convinced that it’s better to post something that might look cringy later (which would show growth anyway) than being afraid to challenge myself. Super glad I pushed past my comfort zone and just went for it.</p>
<h3 id="lowlight-spent-too-much-time-on-social-media-">Lowlight: spent too much time on social media 😆</h3>
<p>Without the usual corporate structure, my schedule went all over the place. Also I thought I’d love the break from back-to-back meetings, but it turns out I kind of missed the social interactions, and ended up compensating for it by spending way too much time on social media.</p>
<p>I gave myself some slack since this is the first week of the sabbatical, but took some learnings anyway.</p>

<p>Ran into an awesome Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3trackslive">(3Tracks Live | 辦公室音樂雜誌)</a> featuring indie musicians from Hong Kong / Taiwan. I rarely listen to hip-hop but really digged <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR-yLsEEZLw">禪波 ZENBØ</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_t67CFBeu4">NKidd</a>.</p>
