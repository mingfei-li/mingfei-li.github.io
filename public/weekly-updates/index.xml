      <description>Highlight: made a blog post about my sabbatical plan I pretty much stopped sharing online after becoming a manager. Initially I thought it was because of lack of motivation – meetings seemed to have sucked up all my desire for expression, and I didn’t bother to get stuff cleared by comms. Later I realized that it was really imposter syndrome that held me back the most – I was worried that I’d say something dumb and all my colleagues and reports would notice and think I&amp;rsquo;m an idiot.</description>
