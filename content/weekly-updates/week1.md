### Highlight: made a blog post about my sabbatical plan

I pretty much stopped sharing online after becoming a manager. Initially I thought it was because of lack of motivation ‚Äì meetings seemed to have sucked up all my desire for expression, and I didn‚Äôt bother to get stuff cleared by comms. Later I realized that it was really imposter syndrome that held me back the most ‚Äì I was worried that I‚Äôd say something dumb and all my colleagues and reports would notice and respect me less.

I literally debated with myself for days ‚Äì should I make a blog post, vlog, or just forget about it and save some time? Eventually convinced myself to at least start a draft and if I didn‚Äôt like it, I simply wouldn‚Äôt have to post it. Turns out the draft felt OK, and I was convinced that it‚Äôs better to post something that might look cringy later (which would show growth anyway) than being afraid to challenge myself. Super glad I pushed past my comfort zone and just went for it.

### Lowlight: spent too much time on social media üòÜ
Without the usual corporate structure, my schedule went all over the place. Also I thought I‚Äôd love the break from back-to-back meetings, but it turns out I kind of missed the social interactions, and ended up compensating for it by spending way too much time on social media.
 
I gave myself some slack since this is the first week of the sabbatical, but took some learnings anyway.
1. I should define clear goals and follow a rigorous routine for ‚Äúwork days‚Äù
2. I should bump up IRL meetings (hit me up if you‚Äôd like to grab a coffee)
