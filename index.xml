It is considered as the first major success story of deep reinforcement learning due to its super-human level performance in Atari games &amp;ndash; it takes only raw pixels as input (i.e., it &amp;ldquo;sees&amp;rdquo; exactly what a human sees), and is able to outperform humans in a wide range of Atari games.</description></item><item><title>Leaving Facebook/Meta</title><link>https://mingfei.io/leaving-fb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mingfei.io/leaving-fb/</guid><description>I left Facebook/Meta on Friday.
When I joined Facebook 11 years ago, I was just hoping to work with cool hackers for a few years, experience the Silicon Valley tech scene, make some money, and then go back to school to continue my theoretical computer science research. I soon became obsessed with the impact I got to make on billions of people, the coworkers I got to collaborate with and learn from, and the new skills and mindset shifts I got to pick up every day.</description></item><item><title>Google Cloud Setup for Deep Learning</title><link>https://mingfei.io/gcp-setup/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mingfei.io/gcp-setup/</guid><description>Introduction Unlike most deep learning courses that teach you the core concepts based on toy examples, the course I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking recently, Deep Learning Fundametals, gets you hands-on with the latest open-source tools for training real-world deep learning models. While this sounds exciting, it does demand more than the conventional Google Colab / Macbook development environments can offer â€“ without some serious GPU power, it takes forever to train a ResNet-50 from scratch or fine tune all parameters of a DistilBert model.</description></item></channel></rss>
